<h1><a id="id245" name="id245">About launching Kirikiri</a>
</h1><div class="para"><div>
　To start Kirikiri and specify a script, you usually need to determine the <a id="id246" name="id246" class="targanchor"><dfn>project folder</dfn></a> (see <a target="main" class="jump" href="StorageSystem.html">Storage system</a>).<br />
　There are several ways to determine the project folder, but they take precedence in the order listed below (applied if applicable at the top).<br />
　See <a target="main" class="jump" href="CommandLine.html">Command line options</a> for options to pass to Kirikiri at startup.<br />
</div></div>
<h1><a id="id247" name="id247">Project folder determination order</a>
</h1><div class="para"><div>
<dl>
<dt>Folders and archives specified on the command line</dt>
<dd>　If a folder is specified as a command line argument, it is assumed to be a project folder and executed.<br />
　If an XP3 archive is specified as a command line argument, it will assume that the project folder is in it and execute it.<br />
　You can also specify a file or folder as a command line argument from the command prompt, but the easiest is to drop the project folder or file on the executable file icon of Kirikiri with Explorer or Open. It is to do.<br />
　It may also be useful to have a shortcut on the desktop, such as a specific project folder, as an argument to the Kirikiri executable.</dd>
<dt>content-data folder in the same location as the executable</dt>
<dd>　If there is a folder named &quot;content-data&quot; in the same location as the executable file, it will be regarded as the project folder and executed.</dd>
<dt>&quot;data.xp3&quot; file in the same location as the executable</dt>
<dd>　If there is an archive file named data.xp3 in the same location as the executable file, it will assume that the project folder is in it as XP3 archive format and execute it.</dd>
<dt>The data folder in the same location as the executable</dt>
<dd>　If there is a folder named &quot;data&quot; in the same location as the executable file, it will be regarded as the project folder and executed.</dd></dl><br />
　If you can not decide by any of the methods, the folder / archive selection screen will appear.<br />
　However, if &quot;Run from XP3 archive only&quot; is specified in the release option, only the operation in the case of data.xp3 file, data.exe file, and &quot;When XP3 archive is combined with itself&quot; (see <a target="main" class="jump" href="Configure.html">Kirikiri setting</a>).<br />
</div></div>
<h1><a id="id248" name="id248">Select folder / archive</a>
</h1><div class="para"><div>
　The folder / archive selection screen is as follows.<br />
<img width="387" height="320" alt="FolderSelector.png" src="FolderSelector.png" /><br />
<br />
<dl>
<dt>&quot;OK&quot; button</dt>
<dd>　Starts execution of the currently selected folder or file.</dd>
<dt>&quot;Cancel&quot; button</dt>
<dd>　Quit Kirikiri without doing anything.</dd></dl></div></div>
<h1><a id="id249" name="id249">File to be executed first</a>
</h1><div class="para"><div>
　After the project folder is determined, the first thing executed is startup.tjs in the project folder. Otherwise, an error occurs.<br />
　The file to be executed first can be specified with -startup. See <a target="main" class="jump" href="CommandLine.html">Command line options</a>.<br />
</div></div>
<h1><a id="id250" name="id250">Message map file</a>
</h1><div class="para"><div>
　Kirikiri checks whether msgmap.tjs exists in the same folder as Kirikiri immediately after startup, and executes it if it exists. Unless the release option specifies that this should not be read (see <a target="main" class="jump" href="Configure.html">Kirikiri setting</a>). You can use <a target="main" class="jump" href="f_System_assignMessage.html">System.assignMessage</a> in msgmap.tjs to change message assignments. msgmap.tjs can also be created in .<br />
</div></div>
<h1><a id="id251" name="id251">Setting file</a>
</h1><div class="para"><div>
　Kirikiri reads the configuration file (.cf file or .cfu file) created by <a target="main" class="jump" href="Configure.html">Kirikiri setting</a> and operates according to the settings described there.<br />
　See <a target="main" class="jump" href="Configure.html">Kirikiri setting</a> for file names and locations where the files are created.<br />
