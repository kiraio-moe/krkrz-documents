<h1><a id="id100" name="id100">About file corruption check tool</a>
</h1><div class="para"><div>
　The data will be <a id="id101" name="id101" class="targanchor"><dfn>damaged</dfn></a> due to malfunction of the computer at the time of installation or after installation.<br />
　&quot;File Corruption Check Tool&quot; is a tool to detect such &quot;corrupted&quot; files.<br />
<br />
　In order to detect file corruption, the distribution file must be signed in advance with <a target="main" class="jump" href="SignTool.html">Key and signature tools</a>.<br />
　The file corruption check tool also checks the validity of the <a id="id102" name="id102" class="targanchor"><dfn>digital signature</dfn></a> (a file that cannot be validated is treated as &quot;damaged&quot; by this tool).<br />
　The files to be checked are the files under the folder where the file corruption check tool is located (the folders below the folder where the file corruption check tool is located are also searched). Therefore, place this tool in the installation folder.<br />
　This tool checks only signed files and does not check unsigned files. However, in exceptional cases, only the Kirikiri core (or executable file created with Releaser) always checks the signature, so the Kirikiri core must be signed.<br />
<br /><div class="note"><div class="notehead"><span class="noteheadspan">Note</span></div>
The file corruption checker can detect file corruption, but cannot detect the &quot;file does not exist&quot; condition by itself.<br />
If you think the missing file is the cause of the error, you can copy the list of files checked by this tool to the clipboard by &quot;Copy result&quot; of this tool, and send it from the end user Please investigate.<br />
</div><br />
</div></div>

<h1><a id="id103" name="id103">Configuration file of the file corruption check tool</a>
</h1><div class="para"><div>
　&quot;File corruption check tool.exe&quot; in the enduser-tools folder is the core of the file corruption check tool, but its setting file is &quot;File corruption check tool.ini&quot;.<br />
　It is necessary to write the settings of the file corruption check tool here and distribute it with the core of the check tool.<br />
<br /><div class="note"><div class="notehead"><span class="noteheadspan">Note</span></div>
　If you change the name of &quot;File corruption check tool.exe&quot;, also change the name of the setting file. For example, if &quot;Signature Confirmation Tool.exe&quot; is selected, the setting file should be &quot;Signature Confirmation Tool.ini&quot;.</div><br />

</dd>
<dt>[key]Section - publickey</dt>
<dd>　Specify the <a id="id104" name="id104" class="targanchor"><dfn>public key</dfn></a> to use for verifying the electronic signature.<br />
　Specify the public key here directly (without writing something like 'setting name =') by copying &amp; paste.<br />
</dd></dl>　For an example, please refer to the standard &quot;File Corruption Check Tool.ini&quot; (in the Kirikiri 2 SDK distribution file).</div></div>
