<ptitle>About the rendered font data creation tool</ptitle>
　The rendered font data creation tool is a tool for creating <kw>Rendered font</kw> data. <at href="f_Font_mapPrerenderedFont.html">Font.mapPrerenderedFont</at> can be assigned to the actual font.<r/>
　Rendered means that the font has been previously rendered (in this case, a TrueType outline font must be expanded and converted to a bitmap font). If you do not use this, Kirikiri will render at runtime as needed.<r/>
　Because the rendered font is created in the environment of the creator, using this font allows the same font to be used regardless of the environment of the player.<r/>
　The rendered font data is bitmap font data. In other words, since it is not a scalable (size can be freely changed) font like TrueType, one font file handles only one fixed size font.<r/>
<note>
　The creator of the original font trying to create the data for the rendered font distributes the bitmap data of many characters created from the font together with the game, etc., and combines the bitmap data with the character. If you are uncertain about whether the font is allowed to be used, it is advisable to check with the font's author.<r/>
　By the way, this rendered font file is in Kirikiri's own format and is unlikely to be used for other purposes.<r/>
　The author of Kirikiri is not aware of any problems that occur using this software.<r/>
</note>
<r/>
　This tool does not work on Windows 95 because it relies heavily on the operating system's UNICODE support. It works on Windows 98 / 98SE / ME and Windows NT 4.0, but some functions are limited. All functions can be used with Windows 2000 / XP.<r/>
　Of course, it is the environment in which this font is created that is restricted by the type of OS, regardless of the type of OS that uses the rendered font data created by this tool.<r/>

<ptitle>How to use the rendered font data creation tool</ptitle>
<img src="FontMaker.png"/><r/><r/>
　When the rendered font data creation tool (krkrfont.exe in the tools folder) is executed, the above screen is displayed.<r/>
<r/>
<dl>
<dt>"Font name"</dt>
<dd>
　Specify the font name from which the rendered font data is created. To create a font for vertical writing, select a font with an @ symbol at the beginning.
</dd>

<dt>"Show all TrueType fonts"</dt>
<dd>
　If not checked, only fonts whose character type is Japanese will be listed in "Font Name", but if checked, all TrueType fonts will be displayed.
</dd>

<dt>"Size (character height)"</dt>
<dd>
　Specify the size (character height) of the rendered font to be created in pixels.
</dd>

<dt>"Anti-aliasing"</dt>
<dd>
　Specify whether to perform anti-aliasing. Performing anti-aliasing makes the font smoother.
</dd>

<dt>"Bold"</dt>
<dd>
　Specifies whether to make it bold. This can be checked only on Windows NT OS (NT4, 2000, XP, Vista, 7 etc.).
</dd>

<dt>"Include all characters in font"</dt>
<dd>
　Specifies whether to include all characters present in the font. This can be checked only on Windows NT type OS (except NT4).<r/>
　If checked, all characters contained in the font will be output.<r/>
　If not checked, only characters that correspond to Shift JIS and half-width alphanumeric characters / kana are output.<r/>
<note>
　The behavior when unchecked depends on the locale where this tool operates. Normally, when running on a Japanese version of Windows, only characters that correspond to Shift JIS are output. (I do not know because the author does not have anything other than the Japanese version of Windows)<r/>
</note>
</dd>

<dt>"Include external characters"</dt>
<dd>
　Specify whether to include external characters. This can be selected only on Windows NT OS (except for NT4). In other OS, it is always checked.<r/>
　Gaiji characters can be created with the "Gaiji character editor" that comes with Windows.
</dd>

<dt>"sample"</dt>
<dd>
　Displays a sample of the rendered font created by the selected condition. In this "sample" you can see all the characters that will be output.
</dd>

<dt>"Output File"</dt>
<dd>
　Specify the file to output. The extension of the output file is .tft. Click "Browse" to specify the file in the dialog box.
</dd>

<dt>"Create"</dt>
<dd>
　Create a rendered font file.
</dd>

<dt>"close"</dt>
<dd>
　Exit this tool.
